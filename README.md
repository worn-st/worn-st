# Worn Street

Selling used clothes is already a huge market. The problem is if you can’t sell  used clothes on ebuy or special stores they go trash. The worn street is  service where you sell the items before actually buying it.

So before you buy cocktail dress, you place it on Worn Street. You make a proposal that you deliver the dress in a week. You will be used once or twice. And ready to sell it for half a price.

You get the money before actually  buy so it’s like an instant discount for you.

Buyer on other side  can have an influence on your decision. For example i’ll buy it if used if the dress would be red.
It’s a good first step to get rid of trash.
